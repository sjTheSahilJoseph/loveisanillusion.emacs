** The idea behind loveisanillusin
I personally don't like heavy syntax highlighting.
What I wanted is a very basic, color set.
So I created my own theme. Here I've included my
favorite colors.
Like for example, I like the comments to be different than anything,
so I make then blue, because there is nothing in this theme blue.

Also, no need to highlight every token, just the way I want.
That's why, there is a very high change that it doesn't appeal you.

    I made this theme for myself.
    But feel free to use it if you want to.
